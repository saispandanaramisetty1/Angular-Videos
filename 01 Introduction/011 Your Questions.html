            <p>As you go through the course, you may have questions or something may not work as you expect. So, here are a few of tips for you: </p>

<p><br></p>

<p><strong>1- D</strong><strong><strong>o your research first. This will make you a better and more independent developer.</strong></strong></p>

<p>I can guarantee that in more than 90% of the courses, you can simply type your question or the error message you get in Google and you'll find the solution in less than 10 minutes! </p>

<p>If you can't find your answer, post your question on the discussion board. </p><p><br></p>

<p><strong>2- Help each other. <strong>Answering questions help you better learn the materials in the course.</strong> </strong></p>

<p>So, If you have any spare time, look at the unanswered questions and help your classmates. </p>

<p><strong>Dedicated support </strong><br></p>

<p>I also have a dedicated support person here, Tim Myers. </p>

<p>Tim is a self-taught programmer with degrees in Business and Mathematics.</p>





<p>He first got interested in programming when a Mathematics Professor told him that he might enjoy it.</p>



<p>He is a self-proclaimed "Online Learning" expert and is always learning some new technology or framework. He is especially good at helping people find out what type of learning is best for them.</p>



<p>He attends local meetups and has a passion for helping others learn to program, especially people who don’t think they can do it.</p>



<p>In his spare time, he likes to create iOS apps and he enjoys spending time with his 2-year-old daughter, Sophia.</p>
